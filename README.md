# sudoku-solver

The purpose of the project is to explore potential of the Clojure language while implementing the solution to solve Sudoku.
The implementation is following a brute force (backtracking) algorithm. The simplicity of this algorithm and the ability to test recursive calls were the causes of selecting the algorithm.  

## Usage

The project uses leiningen project manager. The code can either be ran from leiningen REPL or byu building the uber jar.
The uber jar can be executed with following call. 

    $ lein uberjar

The code can then be ran by going to target directory and executing

    $ java -jar sudoku-solver-0.1.0-standalone.jar
